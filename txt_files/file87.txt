PROCESS
Parties can agree to use either confidential process at 
any time or the court may refer matters to mediation. 
Due to the nature of the cases some meetings 
involve only party representatives or proxies. The 
ADR process is uniquely designed for each case 
based on each party’s needs and preferences. If 
you believe your case would benefit from Mediation 
or Restorative Justice, you can discuss it with the 
assigned judge and request ADR or contact the ADR 
Coordinator in your district to further explore ADR 
options. 
MEDIATION
An ADR process in which a neutral third 
party (referred to as a mediator) helps parties 
communicate, identify issues, clarify perceptions, 
and explore options for a mutually acceptable 
outcome.
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE
Restorative Justice focuses on addressing the 
impact of harm caused by another person. It usually 
takes place through a series of facilitated direct or 
indirect conversations in which those harmed and 
those taking responsibility for harm, together with 
impacted communities in some circumstances, work 
through the needs and obligations flowing from that 
harm and how to address the impact and related or 
consequential needs resulting from that harm. 7TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT
