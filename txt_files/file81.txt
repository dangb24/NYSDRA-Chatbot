Dear Counsel/Litigant:  
 
 If you have a case pending in Supreme Court, Civil/Commercial Division  for the Seventh 
Judicial District , this Court has a free Mediation Program that provides full mediation at no cost.  
The mediations are conducted by Court Mediators Adrian J. Burke, Esq. and Amy L. DiFranco, 
Esq.  Everything that takes place during the mediation is confidential.  All mediations at this time 
are taking place via computer conference technology, namely Microsoft Teams.  If you are 
ultimately unable to resolve your matter in mediation, the case is simply restored to the Court’s 
calendar.  
 
 Why Mediate?  
 
 Mediation offers the followin g benefits:  
 
 1. Allows the parties to maintain control over the outcome of their claims  
 2. Improves parties’ satisfaction with the process  
 3. Saves money  
 4. Speeds settlement and resolution of litigation  
  
 The Court system strongly encourages you to m ediate your case at the earliest possible 
time.  Court Mediation requires that all parties voluntarily consent to be referred to mediation.  In 
addition to obtain ing a referral to mediation though an Order of Referral to Mediation entered by 
the assigned judge, we are now offering access to Court Mediation where the parties execute and 
file the attached Consent to Mediate.  When the Consent is executed and filed, your case will be 
accepted into Court Mediation .  If a Consent is not filed, the case will remain with the assigned 
judge . 
 
 If all parties agree to try mediation, simply complete the attached Consent form , upload it 
to NYSCEF  and email it to adifranc@nycourts.gov  and ADR -7JD@n ycourts.gov .  A Court 
Mediator  will then contact you to proceed with the mediation.
