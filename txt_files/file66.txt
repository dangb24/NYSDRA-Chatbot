of your organization to the interpreter, provide specific 
instructions of what needs to be done or obtained and let 
him/her know whether you need help with placing a call. 
If you need the interpreter to help you place a call to the 
limited English Proficient (LEP) customer, you may ask the 
interpreter for a dial-out. There is a limited amount of time 
allotted for placing a dial-out once the interpreter is on the 
phone. Therefore, it is important that you provide a brief 
introduction and specific instructions to the interpreter in a 
timely manner.
2. SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER - You 
and your customer can communicate directly with each 
other as if the interpreter were not there. The interpreter 
will relay the information and then communicate the 
customer’s response directly back to you.  
3. SPEAK NATURALLY, NOT LOUDER - Speak at 
your normal pace, not slower. 
 SEGMENTS - Speak in one sentence or two short 
ones at a time. Try to avoid breaking up a thought. 
Your interpreter is trying to understand the meaning 
of what you’re saying, so express the whole thought 
if possible. Interpreters will ask you to slow down or 
repeat if necessary. You should pause to make sure 
you give the interpreter time to deliver your message.  
 CLARIFICATIONS -  If something is unclear, or if the 
interpreter is given a long statement, the interpreter 
will ask you for a complete or partial repetition of 
what was said, or to clarify what the statement 
meant.  
4. ASK IF THE LEP UNDERSTANDS - Don’t assume 
that a limited English-speaking customer understands 
you. In some cultures a person may say ‘yes’ as you 
explain something, not meaning they understand, but 
rather they want you to keep talking because they are 
trying to follow the conversation. Keep in mind that a 
lack of English does not necessarily indicate a lack of 
education.  
5. DO NOT ASK THE INTERPRETER FOR 
THEIR OPINION -  The interpreter’s job is to convey the meaning of the source language and under no 
circumstances may he or she allow personal opinion to 
color the interpretation. Also, do not hold the interpreter 
responsible for what the customer does or does not say. 
For example, when the customer does not answer your 
question.
6. EVERYTHING YOU SAY WILL BE INTERPRETED 
- Avoid private conversations. Whatever the interpreter 
hears will be interpreted. If you feel that the interpreter 
has not interpreted everything, ask the interpreter to 
do so. Avoid interrupting the interpreter while he/she is 
interpreting.
7. AVOID JARGON OR TECHNICAL TERMS - Don’t 
use jargon, slang, idioms, acronyms or technical medical 
terms. Clarify unique vocabulary and provide examples if 
they are needed to explain a term. 
8. LENGTH OF INTERPRETATION SESSION -  When 
you’re working with an interpreter the conversation can 
often take twice as long compared with one in English. 
Many concepts you express have no equivalent in other 
languages, so the interpreter may have to describe or 
paraphrase many terms you use. Interpreters will often 
use more words to interpret what the original speaker says 
simply because of the grammar and syntax of the target 
language.  
9. READING SCRIPTS -  People often talk more quickly 
when reading a script. When you are reading a script, 
prepared text or a disclosure, slow down to give the 
interpreter a chance to stay up with you. 
10. CULTURE -  Professional interpreters are familiar with 
the culture and customs of the limited English proficient 
(LEP) customer. During the conversation the interpreter 
may identify and clarify a cultural issue they may not think 
you are aware of. If the interpreter feels that a particular 
question is culturally inappropriate, he or she might ask 
you to either rephrase the question. You may or ask the 
interpreter to help you to get the information in a more 
appropriate way.
11. CLOSING OF THE CALL -  The interpreter will wait for 
you to initiate the closing of the call. When appropriate, 
the interpreter will offer further assistance and will be the 
last to disconnect from the call.  Remember to thank the 
interpreter for his or her efforts at the end of the session.11 Helpful Tips for Working with
