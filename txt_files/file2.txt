(2) advising that a separate legal opinion on the matter be
sought for presentation to an approp riate authority in
the organiz ation; and

authority that can act in behalf of the organiz ation as
determined  by applicable law.

injury to the organiz ation , the lawyer may reveal confid ential information only if
permitted  by Rule 1. 6, and  may resign in accord ance with Rule 1. 16.
(d) A lawyer represen ting an organiz ation may also represent any of its
directors,  officers,  employees,  members,  sharehold ers or other constitue nts, subject

reasonably necessary protective action,  includ ing consulting with individuals or
entities that have the ability to take action to protect the client and, in appropria te
cases,  seeking the appointment of a guard ian ad  litem,  conservator or guard ian.
-21-

(2) A lawyer or law firm that provid es nonlegal services
to a person that are distinct from legal services being

(3) A lawyer or law firm that is an owner,  controlling

RULE 5.8.
Contract ual Relat ionship Bet ween  Lawyers an d Non legal P rofession als
(a)The practice of law has an essential trad ition  of complete independ ence
and uncompromised  loyalty to those it serves.   Recogniz ing this trad ition,  clients of
lawyers practicing in New York State are guaranteed  “ind epend ent prof essional
judgment and und ivided loyalty uncompromised  by conflicts of interest. ”  Indeed,
these guarantees repre sent the very found ation of the profession and allow and
foster its continued  role as a protector of the system of law.  Therefore,  a lawyer
must remain completely  responsible for his or her own independ ent professional
judgment,  maintain the confid ences and secrets of clients,  preserve fund s of clients
and third  parties in his or her control,  and otherwise comply with the legal and
ethical principles governing lawyers in New York State.
Multi-d isciplinary practice between lawyers and nonlawyers is
incompatible with the core values of the legal profession and therefore,  a strict
division between services provid ed by lawyers and those provid ed by nonlawyers is
essential to protect those values.   However,  a lawye r or law firm may enter into and
maintain a contractual relationship with a nonlegal professional or nonlegal
professional service firm for the purpose of offering to the public,  on a systematic
and continuing basis,  legal services performed  by the lawyer or law firm as well as
other nonlegal professional services,  notwithstand ing the provisions of Rule 1.7(a),
provid ed that:
(1) the profession of the nonlegal professional or nonlegal
professional service firm is includ ed in a list jointly
established  and maintained  by the Appellate Divisions
pursu ant to Section 1205. 3 of the Joint Appellate
Division Rules;
-53-
(2) the lawyer or law firm neither grants to the nonlegal
professional or nonlegal professional service firm,  nor
permits such person or firm to obtain,  hold  or
exercise,  directly or indirectly,  any ownership  or
investment interest in, or managerial or supervisory
right,  power or position in connection with the
practice of law by the lawyer or law firm,  nor,  as
provided in Rule 7.2(a)(1),  shares legal fees with a
nonlawyer or receives or gives any monetary or other
tangible benefit for giving or receiving a referral; and
(3) the fact that the contractual relationship exists is
disclosed  by the lawyer or law firm to any client of the
lawyer or law firm before the client is referred  to the
nonlegal professional service firm,  or to any client of
the nonlegal professional service firm before that
client receives legal services from the lawyer or law
firm; and the client has given informed  written
consent and has been provid ed with a copy of the
“Statement of Client ’s Rights In Cooperative Business
Arrangements” pursuant to secti on 1205. 4 of the Joint
Appellate Divisions Rules.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a):
(1) each profession on the list maintained  pursuant to a
Joint Rule of the Appellate Divisions shall have been
designated  sua sponte,  or approved  by the Appellate
Divisions upon application of a member of a nonlegal
profession or nonlegal prof essional service firm,  upon
a determination that the profession is composed  of
individuals who,  with respect to their profession:
(i) have been award ed a bachelo r’s degree or
its equivalent from  an accred ited  college or
univer sity, or have attained  an equivalent
combination of educational cred it from
such a college or university and work
experience;
(ii) are licensed  to practice the profession by
an agency of the State of New York or the
United  States Government; and
-54-
(iii) are required  und er penalty of suspension
or revocation of license to adhere to a code
of ethical cond uct that is reasonably
comparable to that of the legal profession;
(2) the term “ownership or investment interest” shall
mean any such interest in any form of debt or equity,
and shall inclu de any interest commonly consid ered
to be an interest accruing to or enjoyed  by an owner
or investor.
(c) This Rule shall not apply to relationships consisting solely of non-
exclusive reciprocal referral agreements or und erstand ings between a lawyer or
law firm and  a nonlegal professional or nonlegal professional service firm.
-55-
RULE 6.1.
Voluntary P ro Bon o Service
Lawyers are strongly encouraged  to provid e pro bono legal services to
benefit poor persons.
(a)Every lawyer should  aspire to:
(1) provid e at least 50 hours of pro bono legal services
each year to poor persons; and
(2) contribut e financially to organiz ations that provid e
legal service s to poor persons.   Lawyers in private
practice or employed  by a for-profit entity should
aspire to contribute annually in an amount at least
equivalent to (i) the amount typically billed  by the
lawyer (or the firm with  which the lawyer is
associated ) for one hour of time; or (ii) if the lawyer’s
work is performed  on a contingency basis,  the amount
typically billed  by lawyers in the community for one
hour of time; or (iii) the amount typically paid  by the
organiz ation employ ing the lawyer for one hour of the

(1) professional services rend ered  in civil matters,  and in
those criminal matters for which the government is
not obliged  to provid e fund s for legal representation,
to persons who are financially unable to compensate
counsel;
(2) activities related  to improving the administrati on of
justice by simplifying the legal process for, or
increasing the availability and quality of legal services
to, poor persons; and
(3) professional services to charitable,  religious , civic and
educational organizations in matters designed
pred ominantly to ad dress the need s of poor persons.
-56-
(c) Appropriate organiz ations for financial contributions are: 
(1) organiz ations primarily engaged  in the provision  of
legal services to the poor; and
(2) organiz ations substantially engaged  in the provision
of legal services to the poor,  provid ed that the
donated  fund s are to be used  for the provisio n of such
legal services.
(d) This Rule is not intended to be enforced  through the disciplinary
process,  and the failure to fulfill the aspirational goals contained  herein should  be
without legal consequence.
RULE 6.2.
[Reserved]
RULE 6.3.

from those of a client of the lawyer or the lawyer’s firm.  The lawyer shall not
knowingly participate in a d ecision or action of the organiz ation:
(a)if participating in the decision or action would  be incompatible
with the lawyer’s obligations to a client und er Rules 1.7 through
1.13; or

interests of a client may be materially benefitted  by a decision in which the lawyer
actively  participates,  the lawyer shall disclose that fact to the organiz ation,  but need
not identify  the client.  In determining the nature and scope of participation in such
activ ities, a lawyer should  be mind ful of obligations to clients under other Rules,
particularly Rule 1. 7.
RULE 6.5.
