Child Welfare Permanency Mediation Program
Court Improvement Project
The New Y ork State Unified Court System is assembling a roster of paid
Consultant Mediators to mediate child abuse and neglect matters pending
before the F amily Courts in the Ninth J udicial District (Dutchess, Putnam,
Orange, R ockland and Westchester). The program shall operate pursuant to
the R ules of the Chief Administrative J udge (§146).
Appointment to the rosters is at the discretion of the Administrative J udge of
the Ninth J udicial District who, in consultation with the Coordinator of the
NYS Unified Court System's Child Welfare Court Improvement Programs,
shall appoint a committee to review applications and make recommendations
regarding appointment. Applicants may be required to participate in an
interview process before the review committee. Applicants may be requested
to complete additional training or experiential requirements prior to
admission to the roster if, in the opinion of the review committee, the
applicant's mediation training and experience does not fully prepare them for
Consultant Mediator status.
Minimum R equirements for appointment to the roster include completion of
24 hours of training in basic mediation skills and an additional 16 hours of
specific training on mediation of child welfare (abuse and neglect issues).
Applicants must also document substantial recent experience mediating
actual cases, preferably family matters. Substantial recent experience is
defined as at least 20 mediation cases conducted as either a solo or co-
mediator within the last 3 years.
Individuals that have completed the training requirement, but who don't
meet the experiential requirement may be admitted to the roster as an
unpaid apprentice mediator. To attain paid Consultant Mediator status, an
apprentice must conduct 20 mediation sessions as a co-mediator
under the mentorship of a Consultant Mediator or otherwise document that
the experiential requirement has been met and be recommended for
admission by the review committee.
Roster members must attend a minimum of six hours of additional approved
training relevant to child welfare mediation practice every two years to
remain on the roster.
Consultant Mediators will be paid $75 per hour. Billable time will include case
development activities, actual time spent in mediation sessions, and post-
mediation agreement and paperwork  preparation time. Mediators may bill
up to ten (10) hours for each case referred. Additional hours beyond ten
(10) will not be reimbursed unless pre-approved by the Program
Administrator. If a scheduled mediation session cannot be held because a
required party fails to show or for other good cause the Consultant Mediator
may be paid for one hour for that session. Such payment is at the discretion
of the Program Administrator. R easonable travel reimbursement will be
made for mediators traveling more than 35 miles from their home.
Consultant Mediators' responsibilities may include:
• Prompt and efficient management of cases;
• Coordination and scheduling of mediation sessions with all participants;
• Preparation of mediation agreements and/or disposition forms in a format
prescribed by the
program and acceptable to the referring Court;
• Mentoring apprentice and student mediators.
Mediators may be removed from the roster for cause at the discretion of the
Administrative J udge in consultation with the Coordinator of the NY S Unified
Court System's Child Welfare Court Improvement Program.
