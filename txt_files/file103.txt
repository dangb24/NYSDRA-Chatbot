MATRIM ONIAL PART
EARLY NEUTRAL EVALUATION PROGRAM
I. OVERVIEW
Neutral Evaluation is a conf idential alternative dispute resolution process that m ay
result in f aster, m ore convenient, less expensive, and less acrim onious settlem ent than
might be the case in the norm al course of  litigation. In Neutral Evaluation, a neutral third
party  —the Neutral Evaluator — hears abbreviated case presentations by  the parties and
counsel, provides an inf ormal assessm ent of  the strengths and weaknesses of  the
argum ents and m ay offer a non-binding opinion. Neutral Evaluators have signif icant
experience in m atrim onial law and specif ic training in Neutral Evaluation. Their
assessm ents and opinions m ay help parties to analy ze the case, f acilitate discussion, and
generate a settlem ent.  
The Early  Neutral Evaluation Program  (the "ENEP" or the "Program ") offers
parties access to qualif ied Neutral Evaluators who m eet the criteria set out in Section VI.
The goal of  the ENEP is to assist the parties and their counsel in reaching a resolution on
a discrete issue or issues. Although parties are not obligated to settle in Neutral
Evaluation, parties of ten resolve the discrete issue or issues ref erred to the Neutral. 
Parties shall attend the Neutral Evaluation session with their attorney s. Ref erral to the
Program  is not appropriate where only  one party  is represented by  counsel, or in cases of
domestic violence, child abuse, or severe power im balance.
II. DEFINITIONS
"Neutral" shall ref er to Neutral Evaluators.
"Neutral Evaluation" ref ers to a conf idential, non-binding process in which a
neutral third party  (the Neutral Evaluator) with expertise in the subject m atter relating to
the dispute provides an assessm ent of  likely  court outcom es to help parties reach a
settlem ent.
III. PROCEDURES
 The assigned Matrim onial Part Justice or the assigned court attorney -referee m ay
1
refer parties to the Program  with their consent or the parties, on their own, m ay request
referral to the Program .  Cases involving child abuse or neglect (as def ined in Fam ily
Court Act § 1012(e) and (f ) and Social Services Law § 412), dom estic violence, or a
severe power im balance between the parties are not appropriate f or ref erral to the
Program . Cases will be screened to avoid inappropriate ref errals.
To begin the process, the court issues an Order of  Reference on consent of  the
parties. The Order of  Reference specif ies the discrete issue (e.g., child custody , visitation
and/or f inancial issues, including equitable distribution, child support, add-on' s, and
separate property ) to be subm itted to the Program . The Order shall direct parties and
counsel to attend a f ree, 90 m inute session with a Neutral Evaluator f rom the Program 's
Roster of  Neutrals.  If  parties wish to continue bey ond the initial ninety  (90) m inute
session, they  may continue that session or schedule additional sessions. Neutrals shall be
entitled to com pensation f rom the parties at a rate that shall be $400 per hour, f ollowing
the initial session. Pay ment shall be m ade in advance of  scheduled sessions. See Section
VII.
The Order of  Reference shall contain the control date set by  the ref erring Justice or
Court-Attorney  Referee f or the parties to appear in Court f or a conf erence f ollowing the
Neutral Evaluation session. All pre-trial proceedings scheduled in the Prelim inary
Conf erence order shall continue and shall not be stay ed pending the Neutral Evaluation. If
all parties request, the ref erring Justice or Court-Attorney  Referee m ay agree to extend
dates given the particular circum stances presented.  In no event shall the date f or
completion of  discovery  set in the Prelim inary  Conf erence Order or the date f or the
Com pliance Conf erence be extended or adjourned by  reason of  the pendency  of the
Neutral Evaluation.
The Court shall deliver the Order of  Reference to the parties who shall select a
Neutral within f ive business day s of receipt of  the Order. The parties m ay choose a
Neutral Evaluator f rom the Court’s Roster of  Neutrals or they  may choose a Neutral who
is not on the Court’s roster. If  the parties cannot agree on a Neutral, they  shall send
parties shall not disclose who chose which Neutral. The parties shall conf irm in advance
that the two roster Neutrals (a) are available to take the case; (b) do not have a conf lict of
interest.  The ref erring Justice shall then select one of  the Neutrals and notif y the parties
prom ptly of the selection. 
The parties are required to appear at the initial session within ten (10) day s of
selecting the Neutral or receiving notif ication of  the selection.  The parties'  counsel shall
simultaneously  exchange and subm it to the Neutral Evaluator a concise, two-page
summary of the issue presented, relevant f acts, and applicable law, if  any. The parties'
2
counsel shall also subm it (and exchange if  not y et exchanged) copies of  each client' s
sworn statem ent of  net worth. The f oregoing exchange and subm issions shall be m ade so
as to ensure that the Neutral Evaluator receives such subm issions and statem ents of  net
worth at least f ive business day s before the scheduled Neutral Evaluation. The Neutral
Evaluator m ay request lim ited, additional inf ormation, keeping in m ind the additional cost
this m ay cause the respective parties. The Neutral Evaluator m ay further request a
conference call with both attorney s regarding any  prelim inary  matters. The Neutral m ay
give to the parties any  agreem ents or m emorandum  of understating generated at the
sessions.
Within f ive (5) business day s after the conclusion of  the Neutral Evaluation
session(s) — which shall occur whenever af ter the initial session one party , both parties,
or the Neutral decides that the process has ended — the Neutral shall send a Report
(“Report of  the Neutral”) to the Court and to counsel f or the parties stating:
(1) the date of  the initial session and whether each party  and counsel
appeared at the initial session;
(2) the dates of  any subsequent scheduled sessions, but not whether parties
appeared; and
(3) whether the parties reached partial, com plete, or no agreem ent on the
issues.
The Neutral shall not disclose other inf ormation discussed during Neutral
Evaluation, except as described in Section IX.
IV. ROLE OF THE NEUTRAL
The Neutral Evaluator is an expert in the subject m atter of  the issues ref erred who
hears abbreviated case presentations and provides a non-binding assessm ent of the m erits
of the respective claim s in an ef fort to f acilitate settlem ent. The Neutral Evaluator is not
an advocate and m ay give an opinion as to likely  court outcom es. At the parties'  request,
the Neutral Evaluator m ay also provide settlem ent assistance.
At the initial session, the Neutral Evaluator shall explain that all com munications
are conf idential (with narrow exceptions outlined below) and will not be disclosed to the
Justice hearing the case or in any  other judicial or adm inistrative proceeding. The Neutral
Evaluator shall also explain that either party  is free at any  time to end the Neutral
3
Evaluation and return to Court.
During the Neutral Evaluation, each party  relates the f acts of  the dispute and raises
particular issues of  concern. The Neutral Evaluator m ay ask the parties clarif ying
questions related to the issues subm itted.
If the parties reach a written agreem ent during Neutral Evaluation, the parties shall
subm it the agreem ent to their respective attorney s for review.
V. THE ROLE OF PARTIES, COUNSEL,
ATTORNEYS FOR THE CHILD AND GUARDIANS AD LITEM
Experience has dem onstrated that party  participation — as opposed to exclusive
participation by  counsel — not only  increases the likelihood of  settlem ent, but also
improves com pliance with any  agreed-upon term s and enhances the parties'  satisf action.
Accordingly , unless exem pted by  the Neutral f or good cause shown, the parties shall be
present during the Neutral Evaluation session.
The presence of  counsel f or each party  at all Neutral Evaluation sessions is
required.   For those cases in which an Attorney  for the Child or g uardian ad litem has been
assig ned, Neutral Evaluation may  not commence without the appropriate Attorney  or guardian’s
presence, unless the parties ag ree otherwise.
VI. THE ROSTER OF NEUTRALS

Roster m ust com ply with the f ollowing prerequisites: 1

temperam ent, character, and discretion f or appointm ent. Continuing presence on the
Roster is subject to review by  the Adm inistrative Judge. Neutrals m ay be rem oved f rom
the Roster at the discretion of  the Adm inistrative Judge.
VII. FEES
The Program  does not charge or adm inister f ees.   Parties referred to ADR pursuant to

following  the initial 90-minute session and for time spent reviewing  materials submitted by  the
parties for purposes of any  subsequent sessions at a rate of $300.00 per hour. The fee
arrang ement with the Neutral must be ag reed to in writing , and must include the ratio at which
the fee will be divided between the parties . The parties must sig n this fee ag reement before

the Neutral Evaluation — including m emoranda, work products or case f iles of  a Neutral
Evaluator — shall rem ain conf idential and not be subject to disclosure in any  present or
5
future judicial or adm inistrative proceeding. However, Neutral Evaluation shall not be
used as a shield with respect to otherwise discoverable docum ents or inf ormation
produced or occurring prior to or outside of  the Neutral Evaluation process.
Moreover, except as set f orth below, nothing about the substance of  the Neutral
Evaluation, such as the weaknesses or strengths of  the parties'  cases or the relative
willingness of  parties to discuss settlem ent proposals, shall be revealed to the ref erring
Justice, Court-Attorney  Referee, or any  other person by  the Neutral Evaluator or any  party
or attorney . The parties shall report to the Court whether the issue or issues ref erred to the
program  have been "resolved" or "not resolved." If  "resolved" the parties shall prepare
and execute a stipulation f or subm ission to the Court on the discrete issue or issues which

4. Threats of  Imminent, Serious Harm
If a com munication or inf ormation constitutes a credible threat of  serious and
6
imminent harm , either to the speaker or another person or entity , the appropriate
authorities and/or the potential victim  may be notif ied.

XII. REFERRAL TO THE PROGRAM AND ONGOING LITIGATION
Cases m ay be ref erred to Neutral Evaluation on consent of  the parties at any  time,
including at the prelim inary  conf erence. Ref erral to the Program  will not stay  the court
proceedings. The "no stay " policy  recognizes the special need f or prom pt action in
matrim onial and f amily proceedings. Full discovery , emergency  and pendente lite relief ,
family dynamics, and the needs of  children require ongoing access to the Court.
XIII. AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Before accepting a Neutral Evaluation, a Neutral Evaluator shall m ake an inquiry
that is reasonable under the circum stances to determ ine whether there are any  known f acts
that a reasonable individual would consider likely  to af fect the im partiality  of the Neutral
7
Evaluator, including a f inancial or personal interest in the outcom e, and an existing or
past relationship with a party , the party ’s attorney s, or a f oreseeable participant in the
Neutral Evaluation. The Neutral Evaluator shall disclose any  such known conf lict to the
parties and counsel as soon as possible bef ore accepting a ref erral.  If the Neutral wishes
to accept a ref erral af ter discovering a potentially  disqualif ying fact, the Neutral is obliged
to disclose the disqualif ying facts to the parties and, where such f acts exist, shall not serve
unless the parties consent in writing. If  a Neutral later learns of  any disqualif ying fact
after accepting a case, the Neutral shall disclose it as soon as practicable. If  unable to
function in a f air and im partial m anner, the Neutral shall seek disqualif ication and notif y
