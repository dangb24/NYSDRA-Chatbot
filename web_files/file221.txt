Program Description

The Problem:

Conflict is unavoidable in life and occurs when individuals or groups do not meet their needs or find satisfaction. While conflict is neither necessarily good nor bad, some situations are more difficult to handle than others and require extra mediation for the best possible outcome.

Our Solution:

Provide peaceful resolution of conflicts to prevent problems from escalating by removing parties from the win-lose court setting and inserting into a win-win collaborative setting.

Our Mission:

The Long Island Dispute Resolution Centers (LIDRC) seek to resolve conflicts in Nassau and Suffolk counties by offering dispute resolution services from trained professionals who guide individuals, families, or entities, in a peaceful, neutral and confidential manner to develop mutually acceptable resolutions to a wide variety of disputes.

How We Do it:

LIDRC provides conflict resolution services in the form of arbitration, conciliation, mediation, surrogate decision making, and training. Disputes handled at our center include:

Family Conflicts: Divorce, Parent/Child, Elder Care, and Succession Planning.

Special Education Issues: Special Education Mediation Nassau and Suffolk, Early Intervention, and Adult Career and Continuing Education Services.

Community Disputes: Neighbor, landlord/tenant, small claims disputes, lemon law arbitration, agricultural disputes, and workplace disputes.

Other services: Peer Mediation Training and Restorative Practice Circles Training, Surrogate Decision Making

Continuing Education Opportunities for Organizations

If you are returning to the office and need some communication and conflict resolution refresher, the Long Island Dispute Resolution Centers have the solution for you. We’re happy to offer two three-hour interactive workshops, “Constructive Communications in the Workplace” and “Finding the Win-Win at Work,” for employees and managers alike. Additionally, we offer customized seminars and training events for organizations. Contact us today at ADRtraining@eac-network.org to set up a workshop for your organization and learn practical ways to resolve conflict on the job.

Constructive Communications in the Workplace

This interactive workshop will examine the science of conflict and offer strategies to improve communication in the workplace and prevent the escalation of conflict. Participants will engage in several activities and exercises to increase their skills, including active listening, reframing, and perspective-taking.

Finding the Win-Win at Work

Are you a collaborative problem solver looking to enhance your skills? During this interactive workshop, participants will review conflict styles and understand how to work together using a collaborative style as a team to find solutions that meet everyone’s needs. Additionally, participants will learn about different processes available to resolve conflict at work. Participants will have the opportunity to practice and build their skills.

Continuing Education Opportunities for Mediators

Basic Mediation Training

Our Basic Mediation Training provides participants with an overview of the skills and knowledge related to the practice of facilitative mediation. The course content incorporates foundational principles of conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation. After completing the Basic Mediation Training, participants are eligible to apply for Long Island Dispute Resolution Centers’ Mediator Apprenticeship program.

Part 146 Approved, CLE Credits pending

Advanced Training: Core Values of Mediation

Our core values determine our actions in any area of life. What are the pillars of the mediation process, and how do they drive our mediation practice? Relying upon two of the primary ethical codes for mediators, including the Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators and the Standards of Conduct for New York State Community Dispute Resolution Center Mediators, this program provides a deep dive into the core values of mediation: confidentiality, self-determination, safety, quality, and neutrality/impartiality. As we advance our knowledge, we continue to return to the basics — therefore, in this ‘back to the basics’ advanced training, participants apply the core values of mediation through exercises, activities, and role-play scenarios to gain confidence no matter what scenario they encounter while serving as a mediator.

Dates to be Announced shortly; CLE credits pending.

Mediation Apprenticeship

Our Mediation Apprenticeship offers individuals who have completed Basic Mediation Training the opportunity to gain practical experience mediating actual cases and receiving feedback for skill development and growth. Please contact us at ADRtraining@eac-network.org for more information about signing up for our apprenticeship program.

Anti-Bias Training

Are you a mediator on a New York State court roster or a mediator at a CDRC? Our two-hour Anti-Bias Training complies with the New York State court’s new regulation requiring mediators to complete a two-hour Anti-Bias Training. Please contact us at ADRtraining@eac-network.org to inquire about enrollment.

What People Say About LIDRC

When I was told that I could request a mediation to resolve a dispute with my school district about my son’s eligibility for support services, I was quite intrigued. When the district agreed, we went forward with the mediation. We were a little skeptical about how it was going to play out and a little nervous that it wasn’t going to be completely impartial. We ended up more than thrilled with the process and the quality of the mediation. It was impartial, professional, organized, and structured. The mediator was phenomenal with handling a very difficult, complicated, and sensitive case. She was respectful, fair, impartial, knowledgeable, sensitive, assertive, patient, and firm. We were able to come to a mutual agreement which was followed by both parties. We have started fresh with our district and have a new, more positive relationship which we are thrilled about!!! We are so happy to have had the mediation and to have worked with EAC Network and their skilled mediator. We cannot thank them enough!

Jennifer

LIDRC Mediation Client

I walked into the Dispute Resolution Center nervous. I was greeted warmly by the lady at the front desk. I immediately felt calm. The meeting was on time as scheduled. My former tenant was there as well. My former tenant owed me months of rent and moved out owing me over $10,000. He did not contact me for months and I was unable to contact him. I asked for help from other services, but they stated they could only help the tenant, not the landlord. When I heard of EAC Network, I called and spoke with Nicole and she explained the process of mediation. I did not want to take this dispute to court because I could not afford a lawyer. This mediation was such a blessing to me. Everything was handled in a professional manner. My former tenant is cooperating and paying as we agreed upon in mediation!

LIDRC owes its success not only to the staff who share the goal of peaceful resolution, but to the volunteers who give their time, dedication, and talents in helping the community resolve their disputes. Through their humanitarian spirits, the community is a safer and brighter place!

Judy Axelrod

LIDRC Program Director

We did not want to let too much time go by without thanking you for your vital participation in our 18th Annual Safe and Supportive Schools and Communities Conference. The information you shared, the interest and passion you brought to your topic was appreciated and valued by those who heard you speak. The success of that single day is made (or dashed) with the quality of presentations. Although we’ve only briefly scanned our many evaluation forms at this time, we can confidently say that the caliber of workshop presentations this year was top-rated. Many respondents wrote they learned a lot from their specific workshops. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate as a presenter in addition to your participation as a Consortium member. Much appreciated! We look forward to continuing our work together.

Laura Lustbader and Keith Gerber

Conference Co-Coordinators of the Safe and Supportive Schools and Communities Consortium, Peer Mediation Clients

On behalf of Bishop Lawrence Provenzano and the entire team at EMLI, I am writing to thank you for the contribution you made by being present during our Family Summit. We valued your time and appreciated your care so much that we want to inform people about the work of EAC Network and the LI Dispute Resolution Center. We are grateful to have a connection with you and will keep in touch if there are other ways to serve and support your good work. Gregg, THANK YOU. We are grateful for your contribution and for all that you brought into the space to have helped make the day a success.

LIDRC Client

I wish I could help the next guy.  For what it’s worth, I am going to recommend using this program to my friends and colleagues if they have any issues.  This was a very consumer friendly process, and you were always quick with a response and an answer.  You and the arbitrator have my thanks.

Alex

LIDRC Client

Thank you for providing consulting services as well as the necessary training of the John W. Dodd peer mediation team. Immediately after the training was complete a teacher made a referral for two students.

“The two girls were/are best friends and, apparently, have had some sort of disagreement.  I don’t know any specific details. All along they have worked so well together and always paired up for special projects, etc… Now the one has asked for her seat to be moved because they are “no longer friends”…Hopefully, it is not a big issue and can be resolved quickly.”

The two students agreed to have mediation the next day during their lunch period. The peer mediation team prepared for the upcoming mediation; however the mediation did not occur because the two students choose to resolve their conflict privately. The peer mediation team feels this is a success because the upcoming peer mediation appointment encouraged the students to discuss their problems.

We look forward to more success stories. The newly trained mediators plan on starting the 2018-2019 school-year off with an advertising blitz to let their peers learn about this valuable option for conflict resolution. Thank you for support.

Resolving Conflict without Judicial Intervention

Being a volunteer mediator with LIDRC has been and remains an extremely rewarding experience. Despite being a practicing attorney for nearly 20 years, I wasn’t introduced to community mediation programs until a few years ago; I quickly became aware of the essential value they bring to their local communities. Tremendous gratification can be found helping people resolve their conflict(s) through productive communication, avoiding the need for legal and/or judicial intervention.

Jillian

Volunteer Mediator

Helping people through difficult conversations

My biggest satisfaction as a volunteer mediator at Hempstead Small Claims Court is being able to aid parties in having a difficult conversation about their differences in a human-to-human informal way, rather than through the legal procedures required by the Court. Talks are messy, emotional and sometimes loud. Sometimes they get resolved and sometimes not, but everyone gets a chance to speak their mind and be heard

A possible gentler path to understanding and resolving conflict

Volunteering for LIDRC as a mediator has been a unique and personally satisfying experience.

I appreciate that the LIDRC organization strives to provide mediators with ongoing training and apprenticeships, which elevate the professional level of the service that their mediators provide.

LIDRC’s mediation program affords mediators, like myself, the opportunity to facilitate a process that empowers clients to participate in understanding their dispute and to work towards achieving a resolution where possible. The mediation process that LIDRC offers benefits their clients because it allows their voice to be heard, and it allows them the possibility of a self-determinative resolution to their dispute, which is not always afforded the client in conventional legal settings,

LIDRC’s mediation program offers their clients a possible gentler path to understanding and resolving their conflict. It offers mediators, like myself, the satisfaction of helping people to deal with their conflict in a neutral, understanding and professional setting.
