Child Victims Act and Adult Survivors Act Matters

The 7th and 8th Judicial Districts offer both Mediation and Restorative Justice processes to help address Child Victims Act and Adult Survivors Act matters. These Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) opportunities can assist parties in finding an acceptable resolution or a plan to move forward using structured negotiation or facilitated discussions instead of trial.

Process

Parties can agree to use either confidential process at any time or the court may refer matters to mediation. Due to the nature of the cases some meetings involve only party representatives or proxies. The ADR process is uniquely designed for each case based on each party’s needs and preferences. If you believe your case would benefit from Mediation or Restorative Justice, you can discuss it with the assigned judge and request ADR or contact the ADR Coordinator in your district to further explore ADR options.

Mediation

An ADR process in which a neutral third party (referred to as a mediator) helps parties communicate, identify issues, clarify perceptions, and explore options for a mutually acceptable outcome.

Restorative Justice

Restorative Justice focuses on addressing the impact of harm caused by another person. It usually takes place through a series of facilitated direct or indirect conversations in which those harmed and those taking responsibility for harm, together with impacted communities in some circumstances, work through the needs and obligations flowing from that harm and how to address the impact and related or consequential needs resulting from that harm.
