Alternative Dispute Resolution for the 6th JD

Alternative Dispute Resolution remains a crucial part of the business of the courts.  As we continue to respond to the COVID-19 emergency, Hon. Lawrence K. Marks, Chief Administrative Judge included in his Order of May 1, 2020, that “Judges may resume referral of matters for alternative dispute resolution, including to neutrals on court-established panels, community dispute resolution centers, and ADR-dedicated court staff.” [https://www.nycourts.gov/whatsnew/pdf/AO-87-20.pdf]

Please allow this to provide a point of easy reference for districts 5,6,7,8 and the Court of Claims.

In addition to those covered by these categories, many communities are also home to talented mediators and other neutrals who practice privately.
