These Alternative Dispute Resolution opportunities can assist parties in finding an acceptable resolution or a plan to move forward using structured negotiation or facilitated discussions instead of trial. Process Parties can agree to use either confidential process at any time or the court may refer matters to mediation. Due to the nature of the cases some meetings involve only party representatives or proxies. The process is uniquely designed for each case based on each partyâ€™s needs and preferences. If you believe your case would benefit from Mediation or Restorative Justice, you can discuss it with the assigned judge and request or contact the Coordinator in your district to further explore options. Mediation An process in which a neutral third party (referred to as a mediator) helps parties communicate, identify issues, clarify perceptions, and explore options for a mutually acceptable outcome. Restorative Justice Restorative Justice focuses on addressing the impact of harm caused by another person. It usually takes place through a series of facilitated direct or indirect conversations in which those harmed and those taking responsibility for harm, together with impacted communities in some circumstances, work through the needs and obligations flowing from that harm and how to address the impact and related or consequential needs resulting from that harm. 7th Judicial District Cayuga, Livingston, Monroe, Ontario, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Yates Coordinator: Amy Esq.
